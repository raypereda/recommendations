General New Orleans Travel Tips
-------------------------------

At night, do not walk in poorly lit areas on the edge of the French quarter.
People get mugged, and killed on regular basis. Don’t ever put your wallet
in your back pocket in the French quarter. There are pick pockets everywhere.
Put it deep in your front pocket. The pick pocket when you are in a crowd.

Walk up and down the Bourbon street with a drink in your hand. People watch
During the weekends.

Don’t go near Armstrong Park after 4:00. You could get mugged.
